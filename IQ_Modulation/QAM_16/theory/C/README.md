# C QAM-16
THeory behind the planned Verilog implementation of a QAM-16 tx/rx ultrasonic communication system. Based on the signed Q15 datatype. Assumed sampling via. signed differential ADC.  
  
Distance and {OTHER PARAMETERS} can be input via the argument values. LO phase/constellation reconstruction and adjustment algorithms built in for testing recovery techniques via. pilot symbols.  
  
No dependencies.
